# AngularJS-1.6-Tutorial
 Learning AngularJS for work

 Uses AngularJS 1.6 DOES NOT USE Angular.

 AngularJS is the first edition(?) of Angular.
 It uses javascrypt (js), not typescrypt(ts).
 Angular was also greatly changed from version 1.X to 2.X.
 Angular has changed even more and is now on version 8+ (+ incase it comes out with more versions).

 I was told that a web app I would be working uses MEAN stack.
 I studied up on NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Angular, however Angular is vastly different from AngularJS (Angular 1.0).
 If you wish to compare Angular to Angular JS, check out my other repository linked below:
 https://github.com/Joseph-King/Angular-Crash-Course

 If you check that out you will almost immediately see (just from the directory structure) that Angular and AngularJS are practically two different things.
 Hopefully you do not make the same mistake I have.
